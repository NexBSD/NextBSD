/*

 *
 *  (b)  The timestamp clock must not be "too fast".
 *
 *      The recycling time of the timestamp clock MUST be greater than
 *      MSL seconds.  Since the clock (timestamp) is 32 bits and the
 *      worst-case MSL is 255 seconds, the maximum acceptable clock
 *      frequency is one tick every 59 ns.
 */

/*
 * The minimum permissible timestamp is 59ns. However, to reduce calculation
 * overhead we use 256 - (8 bit shift).
 *  - (1<<32)/(1000000000/59) == 253
 *  - (1<<32)/(1000000000/60) == 257
 *
 *
 * Note that MSL should be a function of RTT. Although 60ns is more than sufficient resolution for
 * the time being a 255s MSL on data center network with a sub-millisecond RTT doesn't make a whole
 * lot of senese. In the future the MSL should be determined dynamically or at the very least con-
 * figurable per subnet. Nonetheless, fixing the timestamp clock at a rate corresponding to a 256s
 * MSL gives us what we need for now while otherwise remaining as RFC compliant as possible.
